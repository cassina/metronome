## Development

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## PWA

The app ships as an installable PWA. A service worker caches the app shell and static assets so the metronome works offline. Use the 'Install' button or browser menu to add it to your home screen.

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```
